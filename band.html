          Although rooted in alternative metal, Linkin Park became one of the most successful acts of the 2000s by
          welcoming elements of hip-hop, modern rock, and atmospheric electronica into their music. The band's rise was
          indebted to the aggressive rap-rock movement made popular by the likes of Korn and Limp Bizkit, a movement
          that
          paired grunge's alienation with a bold, buzzing soundtrack. Linkin Park added a unique spin to that formula,
          however, focusing as much on the vocal interplay between singer Chester Bennington and rapper Mike Shinoda as
          the band's muscled instrumentation, which layered DJ effects atop heavy, processed guitars. While the group's
          sales never eclipsed those of its tremendously successful debut, Hybclass Theory, few alt-metal bands rivaled
          Linkin Park during the band's heyday.

        <p class="band_info">
          Linkin Park unveiled The Hunting Party in June 2014. The album -- produced by the bandmembers themselves --
          was
          inspired by the punk, metal, and hardcore they had listened to as teens. The resulting collection was loud,
          raw, and heavy, featuring guest appearances by Tom Morello, System of a Down's Daron Malakian, Helmet's Page
          Hamilton, and hip-hop legend Rakim. Although it was kept out of the top spot on the U.S. charts, it hit
          number
          one in half a dozen countries around the world, and became one of the year's biggest sellers in hard rock
          circles. When Linkin Park returned in 2017, they were accompanied by a drastic shift in their sound. "Heavy,"
          a
          duet featuring singer Kiiara and production by pop songwriters Julia Michaels and Justin Tranter, appeared on
          the band's seventh effort, One More Light. It became their fifth number one album. Barely two months after
          its
          release, one week before beginning a major American tour, Bennington was found dead at his home in Southern
          California; he was 41.
